# Introduction

Many people today want to learn how game engines work or how visuals appear on the screen.
Of course, you can study these topics using open-source engines such as Unreal Engine, Unity, or Godot.
However, some people prefer to build things from scratch, without relying on existing tools, engines,
libraries, or frameworks.

Therefore, this repository contains a list of books for those who want to learn graphics programming
or game engine development from the ground up.

> **Note:** This list is currently incomplete and may be expanded in the future.
> I have not yet finished reading all of the books listed, and some of them are recommended by experts in their respective fields.
